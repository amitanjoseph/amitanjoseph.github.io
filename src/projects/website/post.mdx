There's not much to say here - I finally made a website! I think I did choose
 quite a good tech stack for this project: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
 does a lot of heavy lifting, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes 
 prototyping styles extremely fast. It's taken a long time, but I think I 
 finally get CSS - I know the difference between margin and padding! The hardest
 thing was probably making sure everything works for different sized screens (try
 the website out on your phone!) and also making sure it obeys your preferred colour 
 scheme. Other than Astro and Tailwind, I write these posts in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). 
 Why? Mainly because I anticipate using its extensions in the future to add some
 interactive stuff. Right now though, I'm just using it like normal markdown. Anyway,
 I hope you like the website! I designed it myself, and though I'm not too much of a 
 fan of minimalist black and white, I think it looks pretty good. I might make it more 
 colourful in the future, but I'll wait till I get more time first. Almost forgot to
 mention, the font used all over the website is [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree).
 Honestly, I'm really glad I chose this font at the very start. It looks great!
