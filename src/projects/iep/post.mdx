A big chunk of coursework we had to complete was the Integrated
 Electrical Project (IEP). We spent multiple weeks building circuits
 and analysing them using the [Picoscope](https://www.picotech.com/products/oscilloscope),
 a USB oscilloscope. All the learning we did then accumulated into 1
 last final project - to design a circuit that could play a sound
 with pitch varying with an accelerometer reading. Here's the final result:

It may look like a mess of wires, but it works! You can see its main 
 components below.

It works by using a difference amplifier to adjust and amplify the 
 accelerometer signal to ranging from 0 to 2V across the range of 
 motion. The voltage frequency generator then takes that as input
 and outputs a square wave of frequency depending on the input voltage.
 This is then fed to a mosfet used to drive a speaker.

Debugging real circuits is hard but overall quite fun!
